# Traffic Speed Forecasting using GNN and LSTM

This repository explores innovative methods for predicting road segment speeds using historical time-series data, with a focus on integrating both traditional machine learning techniques and advanced neural network models.

## Project Description

The purpose of this project is to evaluate two different approaches for traffic speed forecasting:

1. **Traditional Approach**: Utilizes XGBOOST, a well-known machine learning algorithm, to predict the speed of individual road segments based on historical data.

2. **Novel Approach**: Inspired by the work of Arash Khodadadi and further based on research by Bing et al., this method leverages a Graph Neural Network (GNN) combined with Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks. This approach considers the relationships between multiple road segments to enhance prediction accuracy.

## Data Description

The dataset used in this project is derived from the PeMSD7 dataset, which was processed and cleaned by Yu et al. This dataset provides detailed traffic speed recordings and is specifically designed to support advanced traffic analysis and forecasting models.

**Data Files**:
- `PeMSD7_W_228.csv`: Contains the distances between 228 monitoring stations in California's District 7.
- `PeMSD7_V_228.csv`: Comprises traffic speed data collected from these stations during weekdays in May and June of 2012.

## Methodology

### XGBoost Model
- **Feature Engineering**: Includes time of day, day of the week, and derived features like rolling means and lagged features.
- **Model Training**: Employs cross-validation to prevent overfitting and ensure generalization.

### GNN/LSTM Model
- **Graph Construction**: Represents the traffic network as a graph where nodes are road segments.
- **Model Training**: Combines graph convolution layers with LSTM to handle both spatial and temporal data.

## Figures
